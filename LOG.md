# Experiment Log

A dated, running journal of what we try, what we find, and why we made each call.
`CLAUDE.md` holds the accumulated *current state* of project knowledge (decisions,
findings, status); this file is the *story* of how we got there, kept mainly so you
can track your own learning as we go. New AI/ML terms get a one-line explanation the
first time they show up, then get added to the Glossary at the bottom.

## 2026-08-03 — GitHub setup: keeping large/licensed data out of git

Set up the repo to be pushed to GitHub. Found `PDFs/` (834MB) and the Common Voice
audio corpus (`cv-corpus-.../`, 265MB) sitting in the single local "initial commit,"
never pushed anywhere yet.

**Decision: excluded both via `.gitignore`.** Two separate reasons:
1. **Size** — pushing ~1.1GB of binaries means every future clone downloads it all,
   forever.
2. **Licensing** — most PDFs are non-commercial-licensed (Dr. Javaid Rahi's works,
   CC-BY-NC-4.0-style) and Common Voice's terms don't allow re-hosting. Publishing
   them on a public GitHub repo isn't just wasteful, it's likely not allowed.

Since nothing had been pushed to a remote yet, the local "initial commit" was
*amended* (not a new commit — only safe because it was still 100% local) to drop the
large files from history entirely, instead of just hiding them from future commits.
`git gc` confirmed the cleanup: `.git` folder dropped from 881MB → 5.4MB.

**Mistake made here, noted so it doesn't repeat**: as part of that cleanup I ran
`git gc --prune=now`, which permanently deleted the *original* (pre-correction)
version of `dict_alif_draft.txt` from git history, since it was only sitting in an
now-unreachable commit. Net effect: we lost the ability to diff your `dict_alif`
corrections against the original draft. The corrected file itself is fine — only the
"what changed" view for that one file is gone.

**Lesson for later**: this history-rewrite trick only works *before* the first push.
Once something's pushed to a shared remote, removing large files from history needs
a proper rewrite tool (e.g. `git filter-repo`) and is riskier since anyone who
already pulled keeps the old history.

Also configured a Python `.env` file (gitignored, never committed) for API keys, so
future keys get typed into a file instead of pasted into chat.

## 2026-08-03/04 — Gold-set corrections: first real patterns

You started hand-correcting the OCR gold-set drafts (`data/gold/images/*_draft.txt`)
against the source page images. `dict_alif` and `gojri_adbiyaat` done so far
(`gojri_adbiyaat` in two rounds — a small kasra fix, then a larger pass).

**Finding, from the `gojri_adbiyaat` diff** (no diff available for `dict_alif` — see
the git mistake above):

1. **Heh confusion.** Urdu/Nastaliq has two different "h" letters that look similar:
   plain heh (ه) and do-chashmi heh (ھ, "two-eyed heh"), which marks aspirated sounds
   like دھ, بھ, مھ. The draft kept using the wrong one, e.g. `مانہ` → corrected to
   `مانھ`. This isn't cosmetic — it changes which consonant is represented.

2. **Poems don't get their own repetition checked.** A ghazal repeats the same
   rhyming word (the *radif*) at the end of every line. The draft mis-transcribed
   that repeated word *consistently but not identically* across lines:
   - `جایے` → `جائیے` (missing ئ), wrong in 4/4 lines
   - `ہن کے` → `بن کے` (ہ misread as ب), wrong in 4/4 lines
   - `یاں` → `یال` (nasalization ں misread as ل), wrong in 3/4 lines

   A person catches this instantly from the rhyme; the model transcribes each line
   independently and doesn't cross-check itself against the pattern it just produced
   two lines earlier.

3. **Confident wrong guesses on unusual/dialectal words** — e.g. `نچ`→`بِچ`,
   `چیُو`→`چپُو`, `کھڑیاں ہن کے`→`کھڈیال بن کے`. Fluent-looking Nastaliq, just wrong.
   This is the "hallucination" risk `CLAUDE.md` already flagged (**hallucination**:
   a model producing a plausible, fluent-sounding answer that isn't actually
   grounded in what's on the page — different from a traditional OCR engine failing
   visibly/blank when unsure).

## 2026-08-03/04 — First OCR model comparison: Gemini

**Goal**: start comparing OCR quality/cost across models — this entry is step one of
that, not a conclusion.

**Setup**: Got a Gemini API key (stored in `.env`, not committed). Checked Google's
own docs directly rather than trusting blog aggregators (they had wrong model names)
and confirmed the current lineup:
- `gemini-3.6-flash` — newest stable model, Google's own words: "our latest model...
  strong performance in agentic and multimodal tasks." **Flash** = Google's
  cheaper/faster tier, as opposed to **Pro** (more capable, more expensive).
- `gemini-2.5-pro` — current stable Pro tier (no newer Pro is out of preview yet).

Picked `gemini-3.6-flash`: it's both "latest" and the cost-sensitive choice, same
logic as the Haiku-vs-Sonnet tradeoff already in `CLAUDE.md`'s OCR cost math — for a
14,761-page OCR workload, cost tier matters as much as raw quality.

Wrote [scripts/gemini_ocr_test.py](scripts/gemini_ocr_test.py) — takes an image
path, sends it to Gemini with a transcription-only prompt (see exact prompt text in
the file), prints + saves the result as `<name>_gemini.txt` next to the draft.

**Result on `dict_alif.png`**:
- **Cost**: ~1,267 input tokens + 511 output tokens for one page. (**Token**: the
  unit models bill by — roughly a word-piece; a whole page of dense Nastaliq is
  ~1,000+ tokens because Perso-Arabic script tokenizes less efficiently than Latin
  script.) Comfortably inside Gemini's free tier.
- **Quality**: same heh-confusion bug as pattern #1 above (`آب و ھوا`→`آب و هوا`),
  plus dropped diacritics (kasra, damma). This is the *second* model showing the
  exact same failure mode — starting to look like a structural weak point of
  Nastaliq OCR in general, not a quirk of one model.
- Also added a bracketed `[Oval: Alif الف]` description not in the draft (needs a
  human check against the actual image — could be a legitimate catch or an
  invention) and a stray divider line.

**Open gap**: the `_draft.txt` baseline files don't have a recorded prompt (see
above), so they aren't a fully controlled comparison point yet. Fine for now since
we're mainly gut-checking quality, but worth fixing if we want rigorous scoring
later.

## 2026-08-04 — Planning: multi-model OCR comparison

**Plan going forward** (your call, recorded here for continuity): compare OCR output
across Gemini, DeepSeek, Claude Sonnet, and Claude Haiku on the same gold-set pages.
Reasoning: open-source/cheaper models are worth a real look before committing to a
paid-per-page pipeline for ~14,761 pages — no reason to assume the most expensive
option wins.

**Convention**: each model's output for a page goes in the same
`data/gold/images/` folder, named `<page_id>_<model>.txt` (e.g. `dict_alif_gemini.txt`,
already created). Once you've hand-corrected enough drafts into a true gold
standard, every model's output can be scored against the same yardstick.

Judgment on which model to actually use is explicitly deferred until the comparison
is in place — not being decided now.

**Started this log file.**

## Glossary (grows as new terms come up)

- **Token**: the unit a model reads/writes in and is billed by — roughly a
  word-piece, not a whole word. Dense Nastaliq text uses more tokens per page than
  the same content in Latin script.
- **Prompt**: the instructions given to a model alongside its input (here, the image)
  telling it what to do. Prompt wording measurably affects output quality — part of
  why exact prompts are being logged from now on.
- **Hallucination**: a model producing a fluent, plausible-looking answer that isn't
  actually grounded in the real input — dangerous because it fails *silently*,
  unlike a traditional OCR engine which tends to fail visibly (blank/garbled) when
  unsure.
- **Flash vs. Pro (Gemini), Haiku vs. Sonnet (Claude)**: within one model family,
  vendors offer a faster/cheaper tier and a slower/more-capable tier. For a
  large-page-count OCR job, the cheaper tier is usually the right starting point
  since cost scales with every page.
- **Radif**: in Urdu/Gojri ghazal poetry, a word or phrase that repeats identically
  at the end of every line/couplet. Relevant to OCR because it's a built-in
  consistency check a model isn't currently using.
